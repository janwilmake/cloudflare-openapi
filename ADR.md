This [llms.txt](llms.txt) is generated based on the OpenAPI of Cloudflare

To improve this further, I'm advocating to:

- Add `descriptions` to tags
- Add `externalDocs` (https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/pubapis_openapi_step8_externaldocs_object.html) referring to a agent-friendly documentation of a specific tags or operation.
