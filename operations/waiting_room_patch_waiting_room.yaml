    Welcome to Cloudflare's API documentation site. We are experimenting with an
    updated version of our API documentation - check out
    [developers.cloudflare.com/api-next/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api-next/)
    to test out the new experience.


    To get started using Cloudflare's products and services via the API, refer
    to [how to interact with
    Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/basic-tasks/interact-with-cloudflare/),
    which covers using tools like
    [Terraform](https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/#cloudflare-terraform)
    and the [official
    SDKs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/reference/sdks/) to
    maintain your Cloudflare resources.


    Using the Cloudflare API requires authentication so that Cloudflare knows
    who is making requests and what permissions you have. Create an API token to
    grant access to the API to perform actions. You can also authenticate with
    [API
    keys](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/keys/),
    but these keys have [several
    limitations](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/keys/#limitations)
    that make them less secure than API tokens. Whenever possible, use API
    tokens to interact with the Cloudflare API.


    To create an API token, from the Cloudflare dashboard, go to My Profile >
    API Tokens and select Create Token. For more information on how to create
    and troubleshoot API tokens, refer to

    our [API fundamentals](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/).


    For information regarding rate limits, refer to our [API Rate
    Limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/platform/limits/#api-rate-limits).

                    This is a template html file that will be rendered at the
                    edge. If no custom_page_html is provided, the default
                    waiting room will be used. The template is based on mustache
                    ( https://mustache.github.io/ ). There are several variables
                    that are evaluated by the Cloudflare edge:

                    1. {{`waitTimeKnown`}} Acts like a boolean value that
                    indicates the behavior to take when wait time is not
                    available, for instance when queue_all is **true**.

                    2. {{`waitTimeFormatted`}} Estimated wait time for the user.
                    For example, five minutes. Alternatively, you can use:

                    3. {{`waitTime`}} Number of minutes of estimated wait for a
                    user.

                    4. {{`waitTimeHours`}} Number of hours of estimated wait for
                    a user (`Math.floor(waitTime/60)`).

                    5. {{`waitTimeHourMinutes`}} Number of minutes above the
                    `waitTimeHours` value (`waitTime%60`).

                    6. {{`queueIsFull`}} Changes to **true** when no more people
                    can be added to the queue.


                    To view the full list of variables, look at the
                    `cfWaitingRoom` object described under the
                    `json_response_enabled` property in other Waiting Room API

                  description: "Only available for the Waiting Room Advanced subscription. If `true`, requests to the waiting room with the header `Accept: application/json` will receive a JSON response object with information on the user's status in the waiting room as opposed to the configured static HTML page. This JSON response object has one property `cfWaitingRoom` which is an object containing the following fields:\n1. `inWaitingRoom`: Boolean indicating if the user is in the waiting room (always **true**).\n2. `waitTimeKnown`: Boolean indicating if the current estimated wait times are accurate. If **false**, they are not available.\n3. `waitTime`: Valid only when `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the current estimated time in minutes the user will wait in the waiting room. When `queueingMethod` is **random**, this is set to `waitTime50Percentile`.\n4. `waitTime25Percentile`: Valid only when `queueingMethod` is **random** and `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the current estimated maximum wait time for the 25% of users that gain entry the fastest (25th percentile).\n5. `waitTime50Percentile`: Valid only when `queueingMethod` is **random** and `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the current estimated maximum wait time for the 50% of users that gain entry the fastest (50th percentile). In other words, half of the queued users are expected to let into the origin website before `waitTime50Percentile` and half are expected to be let in after it.\n6. `waitTime75Percentile`: Valid only when `queueingMethod` is **random** and `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the current estimated maximum wait time for the 75% of users that gain entry the fastest (75th percentile).\n7. `waitTimeFormatted`: String displaying the `waitTime` formatted in English for users. If `waitTimeKnown` is **false**, `waitTimeFormatted` will display **unavailable**.\n8. `queueIsFull`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room's queue is currently full and not accepting new users at the moment.\n9. `queueAll`: Boolean indicating if all users will be queued in the waiting room and no one will be let into the origin website.\n10. `lastUpdated`: String displaying the timestamp as an ISO 8601 string of the user's last attempt to leave the waiting room and be let into the origin website. The user is able to make another attempt after `refreshIntervalSeconds` past this time. If the user makes a request too soon, it will be ignored and `lastUpdated` will not change.\n11. `refreshIntervalSeconds`: Integer indicating the number of seconds after `lastUpdated` until the user is able to make another attempt to leave the waiting room and be let into the origin website. When the `queueingMethod` is `reject`, there is no specified refresh time —\\_it will always be **zero**.\n12. `queueingMethod`: The queueing method currently used by the waiting room. It is either **fifo**, **random**, **passthrough**, or **reject**.\n13. `isFIFOQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue.\n14. `isRandomQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a Random queue where users gain access randomly.\n15. `isPassthroughQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a passthrough queue. Keep in mind that when passthrough is enabled, this JSON response will only exist when `queueAll` is **true** or `isEventPrequeueing` is **true** because in all other cases requests will go directly to the origin.\n16. `isRejectQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a reject queue.\n17. `isEventActive`: Boolean indicating if an event is currently occurring. Events are able to change a waiting room's behavior during a specified period of time. For additional information, look at the event properties `prequeue_start_time`, `event_start_time`, and `event_end_time` in the documentation for creating waiting room events. Events are considered active between these start and end times, as well as during the prequeueing period if it exists.\n18. `isEventPrequeueing`: Valid only when `isEventActive` is **true**. Boolean indicating if an event is currently prequeueing users before it starts.\n19. `timeUntilEventStart`: Valid only when `isEventPrequeueing` is **true**. Integer indicating the number of minutes until the event starts.\n20. `timeUntilEventStartFormatted`: String displaying the `timeUntilEventStart` formatted in English for users. If `isEventPrequeueing` is **false**, `timeUntilEventStartFormatted` will display **unavailable**.\n21. `timeUntilEventEnd`: Valid only when `isEventActive` is **true**. Integer indicating the number of minutes until the event ends.\n22. `timeUntilEventEndFormatted`: String displaying the `timeUntilEventEnd` formatted in English for users. If `isEventActive` is **false**, `timeUntilEventEndFormatted` will display **unavailable**.\n23. `shuffleAtEventStart`: Valid only when `isEventActive` is **true**.

                    Sets the queueing method used by the waiting room. Changing
                    this parameter from the **default** queueing method is only
                    available for the Waiting Room Advanced subscription.
                    Regardless of the queueing method, if `queue_all` is enabled
                    or an event is prequeueing, users in the waiting room will
                    not be accepted to the origin. These users will always see a
                    waiting room page that refreshes automatically. The valid
                    queueing methods are:

                    1. `fifo` **(default)**: First-In-First-Out queue where
                    customers gain access in the order they arrived.

                    2. `random`: Random queue where customers gain access
                    randomly, regardless of arrival time.

                    3. `passthrough`: Users will pass directly through the
                    waiting room and into the origin website. As a result, any
                    configured limits will not be respected while this is
                    enabled. This method can be used as an alternative to
                    disabling a waiting room (with `suspended`) so that
                    analytics are still reported. This can be used if you wish
                    to allow all traffic normally, but want to restrict traffic
                    during a waiting room event, or vice versa.

                    4. `reject`: Users will be immediately rejected from the
                    waiting room. As a result, no users will reach the origin
                    website while this is enabled. This can be used if you wish
                    to reject all traffic while performing maintenance, block
                    traffic during a specified period of time (an event), or
                    block traffic while events are not occurring. Consider a
                    waiting room used for vaccine distribution that only allows
                    traffic during sign-up events, and otherwise blocks all
                    traffic. For this case, the waiting room uses `reject`, and
                    its events override this with `fifo`, `random`, or
                    `passthrough`. When this queueing method is enabled and
                    neither `queueAll` is enabled nor an event is prequeueing,
                    the waiting room page **will not refresh automatically**.

                              mustache ( https://mustache.github.io/ ). There
                              are several variables that are evaluated by the
                              Cloudflare edge:

                              1. {{`waitTimeKnown`}} Acts like a boolean value
                              that indicates the behavior to take when wait time
                              is not available, for instance when queue_all is
                              **true**.

                              2. {{`waitTimeFormatted`}} Estimated wait time for
                              the user. For example, five minutes.
                              Alternatively, you can use:

                              3. {{`waitTime`}} Number of minutes of estimated
                              wait for a user.

                              4. {{`waitTimeHours`}} Number of hours of
                              estimated wait for a user
                              (`Math.floor(waitTime/60)`).

                              5. {{`waitTimeHourMinutes`}} Number of minutes
                              above the `waitTimeHours` value (`waitTime%60`).

                              6. {{`queueIsFull`}} Changes to **true** when no
                              more people can be added to the queue.


                              To view the full list of variables, look at the
                              `cfWaitingRoom` object described under the

If `true`, requests to the waiting room with the header `Accept: application/json` will receive a JSON response object with information on the user's status in the waiting room as opposed to the configured static HTML page. This JSON response object has one property `cfWaitingRoom` which is an object containing the following fields:\n1. `inWaitingRoom`: Boolean indicating if the user is in the waiting room (always **true**).\n2. `waitTimeKnown`: Boolean indicating if the current estimated wait times are accurate. If **false**, they are not available.\n3. `waitTime`: Valid only when `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the current estimated time in minutes the user will wait in the waiting room. When `queueingMethod` is **random**, this is set to `waitTime50Percentile`.\n4. `waitTime25Percentile`: Valid only when `queueingMethod` is **random** and `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the current estimated maximum wait time for the 25% of users that gain entry the fastest (25th percentile).\n5. `waitTime50Percentile`: Valid only when `queueingMethod` is **random** and `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the current estimated maximum wait time for the 50% of users that gain entry the fastest (50th percentile). In other words, half of the queued users are expected to let into the origin website before `waitTime50Percentile` and half are expected to be let in after it.\n6. `waitTime75Percentile`: Valid only when `queueingMethod` is **random** and `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the current estimated maximum wait time for the 75% of users that gain entry the fastest (75th percentile).\n7. `waitTimeFormatted`: String displaying the `waitTime` formatted in English for users. If `waitTimeKnown` is **false**, `waitTimeFormatted` will display **unavailable**.\n8. `queueIsFull`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room's queue is currently full and not accepting new users at the moment.\n9. `queueAll`: Boolean indicating if all users will be queued in the waiting room and no one will be let into the origin website.\n10. `lastUpdated`: String displaying the timestamp as an ISO 8601 string of the user's last attempt to leave the waiting room and be let into the origin website. The user is able to make another attempt after `refreshIntervalSeconds` past this time. If the user makes a request too soon, it will be ignored and `lastUpdated` will not change.\n11. `refreshIntervalSeconds`: Integer indicating the number of seconds after `lastUpdated` until the user is able to make another attempt to leave the waiting room and be let into the origin website. When the `queueingMethod` is `reject`, there is no specified refresh time —\\_it will always be **zero**.\n12. `queueingMethod`: The queueing method currently used by the waiting room. It is either **fifo**, **random**, **passthrough**, or **reject**.\n13. `isFIFOQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue.\n14. `isRandomQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a Random queue where users gain access randomly.\n15. `isPassthroughQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a passthrough queue. Keep in mind that when passthrough is enabled, this JSON response will only exist when `queueAll` is **true** or `isEventPrequeueing` is **true** because in all other cases requests will go directly to the origin.\n16. `isRejectQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a reject queue.\n17. `isEventActive`: Boolean indicating if an event is currently occurring. Events are able to change a waiting room's behavior during a specified period of time. For additional information, look at the event properties `prequeue_start_time`, `event_start_time`, and `event_end_time` in the documentation for creating waiting room events. Events are considered active between these start and end times, as well as during the prequeueing period if it exists.\n18. `isEventPrequeueing`: Valid only when `isEventActive` is **true**. Boolean indicating if an event is currently prequeueing users before it starts.\n19. `timeUntilEventStart`: Valid only when `isEventPrequeueing` is **true**. Integer indicating the number of minutes until the event starts.\n20. `timeUntilEventStartFormatted`: String displaying the `timeUntilEventStart` formatted in English for users. If `isEventPrequeueing` is **false**, `timeUntilEventStartFormatted` will display **unavailable**.\n21. `timeUntilEventEnd`: Valid only when `isEventActive` is **true**. Integer indicating the number of minutes until the event ends.\n22. `timeUntilEventEndFormatted`: String displaying the `timeUntilEventEnd` formatted in English for users. If `isEventActive` is **false**, `timeUntilEventEndFormatted` will display **unavailable**.\n23. `shuffleAtEventStart`: Valid only when `isEventActive` is **true**.

                              Changing this parameter from the **default**
                              queueing method is only available for the Waiting
                              Room Advanced subscription. Regardless of the
                              queueing method, if `queue_all` is enabled or an
                              event is prequeueing, users in the waiting room
                              will not be accepted to the origin. These users
                              will always see a waiting room page that refreshes
                              automatically. The valid queueing methods are:

                              1. `fifo` **(default)**: First-In-First-Out queue
                              where customers gain access in the order they
                              arrived.

                              2. `random`: Random queue where customers gain
                              access randomly, regardless of arrival time.

                              3. `passthrough`: Users will pass directly through
                              the waiting room and into the origin website. As a
                              result, any configured limits will not be
                              respected while this is enabled. This method can
                              be used as an alternative to disabling a waiting
                              room (with `suspended`) so that analytics are
                              still reported. This can be used if you wish to
                              allow all traffic normally, but want to restrict
                              traffic during a waiting room event, or vice
                              versa.

                              4. `reject`: Users will be immediately rejected
                              from the waiting room. As a result, no users will
                              reach the origin website while this is enabled.
                              This can be used if you wish to reject all traffic
                              while performing maintenance, block traffic during
                              a specified period of time (an event), or block
                              traffic while events are not occurring. Consider a
                              waiting room used for vaccine distribution that
                              only allows traffic during sign-up events, and
                              otherwise blocks all traffic. For this case, the
                              waiting room uses `reject`, and its events
                              override this with `fifo`, `random`, or
                              `passthrough`. When this queueing method is
                              enabled and neither `queueAll` is enabled nor an
                              event is prequeueing, the waiting room page **will
                              not refresh automatically**.

                                  1. {{`waitTimeKnown`}} Acts like a boolean
                                  value that indicates the behavior to take when
                                  wait time is not available, for instance when
                                  queue_all is **true**.

                                  2. {{`waitTimeFormatted`}} Estimated wait time
                                  for the user. For example, five minutes.
                                  Alternatively, you can use:

                                  3. {{`waitTime`}} Number of minutes of
                                  estimated wait for a user.

                                  4. {{`waitTimeHours`}} Number of hours of
                                  estimated wait for a user
                                  (`Math.floor(waitTime/60)`).

                                  5. {{`waitTimeHourMinutes`}} Number of minutes
                                  above the `waitTimeHours` value
                                  (`waitTime%60`).

                                  6. {{`queueIsFull`}} Changes to **true** when
                                  no more people can be added to the queue.


                                  To view the full list of variables, look at

If `true`, requests to the waiting room with the header `Accept: application/json` will receive a JSON response object with information on the user's status in the waiting room as opposed to the configured static HTML page. This JSON response object has one property `cfWaitingRoom` which is an object containing the following fields:\n1. `inWaitingRoom`: Boolean indicating if the user is in the waiting room (always **true**).\n2. `waitTimeKnown`: Boolean indicating if the current estimated wait times are accurate. If **false**, they are not available.\n3. `waitTime`: Valid only when `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the current estimated time in minutes the user will wait in the waiting room. When `queueingMethod` is **random**, this is set to `waitTime50Percentile`.\n4. `waitTime25Percentile`: Valid only when `queueingMethod` is **random** and `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the current estimated maximum wait time for the 25% of users that gain entry the fastest (25th percentile).\n5. `waitTime50Percentile`: Valid only when `queueingMethod` is **random** and `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the current estimated maximum wait time for the 50% of users that gain entry the fastest (50th percentile). In other words, half of the queued users are expected to let into the origin website before `waitTime50Percentile` and half are expected to be let in after it.\n6. `waitTime75Percentile`: Valid only when `queueingMethod` is **random** and `waitTimeKnown` is **true**. Integer indicating the current estimated maximum wait time for the 75% of users that gain entry the fastest (75th percentile).\n7. `waitTimeFormatted`: String displaying the `waitTime` formatted in English for users. If `waitTimeKnown` is **false**, `waitTimeFormatted` will display **unavailable**.\n8. `queueIsFull`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room's queue is currently full and not accepting new users at the moment.\n9. `queueAll`: Boolean indicating if all users will be queued in the waiting room and no one will be let into the origin website.\n10. `lastUpdated`: String displaying the timestamp as an ISO 8601 string of the user's last attempt to leave the waiting room and be let into the origin website. The user is able to make another attempt after `refreshIntervalSeconds` past this time. If the user makes a request too soon, it will be ignored and `lastUpdated` will not change.\n11. `refreshIntervalSeconds`: Integer indicating the number of seconds after `lastUpdated` until the user is able to make another attempt to leave the waiting room and be let into the origin website. When the `queueingMethod` is `reject`, there is no specified refresh time —\\_it will always be **zero**.\n12. `queueingMethod`: The queueing method currently used by the waiting room. It is either **fifo**, **random**, **passthrough**, or **reject**.\n13. `isFIFOQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue.\n14. `isRandomQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a Random queue where users gain access randomly.\n15. `isPassthroughQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a passthrough queue. Keep in mind that when passthrough is enabled, this JSON response will only exist when `queueAll` is **true** or `isEventPrequeueing` is **true** because in all other cases requests will go directly to the origin.\n16. `isRejectQueue`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room uses a reject queue.\n17. `isEventActive`: Boolean indicating if an event is currently occurring. Events are able to change a waiting room's behavior during a specified period of time. For additional information, look at the event properties `prequeue_start_time`, `event_start_time`, and `event_end_time` in the documentation for creating waiting room events. Events are considered active between these start and end times, as well as during the prequeueing period if it exists.\n18. `isEventPrequeueing`: Valid only when `isEventActive` is **true**. Boolean indicating if an event is currently prequeueing users before it starts.\n19. `timeUntilEventStart`: Valid only when `isEventPrequeueing` is **true**. Integer indicating the number of minutes until the event starts.\n20. `timeUntilEventStartFormatted`: String displaying the `timeUntilEventStart` formatted in English for users. If `isEventPrequeueing` is **false**, `timeUntilEventStartFormatted` will display **unavailable**.\n21. `timeUntilEventEnd`: Valid only when `isEventActive` is **true**. Integer indicating the number of minutes until the event ends.\n22. `timeUntilEventEndFormatted`: String displaying the `timeUntilEventEnd` formatted in English for users. If `isEventActive` is **false**, `timeUntilEventEndFormatted` will display **unavailable**.\n23. `shuffleAtEventStart`: Valid only when `isEventActive` is **true**. Boolean indicating if the users in the prequeue are shuffled randomly when the event starts.\n24. `turnstile`: Empty when turnstile isn't enabled. String displaying an html tag to display the Turnstile widget. Please add the `{{{turnstile}}}` tag to the `custom_html` template to ensure the Turnstile widget appears.\n25. `infiniteQueue`: Boolean indicating whether the response is for a user in the infinite queue.\n\nAn example cURL to a waiting room could be:\n\n\tcurl -X GET \"https://example.com/waitingroom\" \\\n\t\t-H \"Accept: application/json\"\n\nIf `json_response_enabled` is **true** and the request hits the waiting room, an example JSON response when `queueingMethod` is **fifo** and no event is active could be:\n\n\t{\n\t\t\"cfWaitingRoom\": {\n\t\t\t\"inWaitingRoom\": true,\n\t\t\t\"waitTimeKnown\": true,\n\t\t\t\"waitTime\": 10,\n\t\t\t\"waitTime25Percentile\": 0,\n\t\t\t\"waitTime50Percentile\": 0,\n\t\t\t\"waitTime75Percentile\": 0,\n\t\t\t\"waitTimeFormatted\": \"10 minutes\",\n\t\t\t\"queueIsFull\": false,\n\t\t\t\"queueAll\": false,\n\t\t\t\"lastUpdated\": \"2020-08-03T23:46:00.000Z\",\n\t\t\t\"refreshIntervalSeconds\": 20,\n\t\t\t\"queueingMethod\": \"fifo\",\n\t\t\t\"isFIFOQueue\": true,\n\t\t\t\"isRandomQueue\": false,\n\t\t\t\"isPassthroughQueue\": false,\n\t\t\t\"isRejectQueue\": false,\n\t\t\t\"isEventActive\": false,\n\t\t\t\"isEventPrequeueing\": false,\n\t\t\t\"timeUntilEventStart\": 0,\n\t\t\t\"timeUntilEventStartFormatted\": \"unavailable\",\n\t\t\t\"timeUntilEventEnd\": 0,\n\t\t\t\"timeUntilEventEndFormatted\": \"unavailable\",\n\t\t\t\"shuffleAtEventStart\": false\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\nIf `json_response_enabled` is **true** and the request hits the waiting room, an example JSON response when `queueingMethod` is **random** and an event is active could be:\n\n\t{\n\t\t\"cfWaitingRoom\": {\n\t\t\t\"inWaitingRoom\": true,\n\t\t\t\"waitTimeKnown\": true,\n\t\t\t\"waitTime\": 10,\n\t\t\t\"waitTime25Percentile\": 5,\n\t\t\t\"waitTime50Percentile\": 10,\n\t\t\t\"waitTime75Percentile\": 15,\n\t\t\t\"waitTimeFormatted\": \"5 minutes to 15 minutes\",\n\t\t\t\"queueIsFull\": false,\n\t\t\t\"queueAll\": false,\n\t\t\t\"lastUpdated\": \"2020-08-03T23:46:00.000Z\",\n\t\t\t\"refreshIntervalSeconds\": 20,\n\t\t\t\"queueingMethod\": \"random\",\n\t\t\t\"isFIFOQueue\": false,\n\t\t\t\"isRandomQueue\": true,\n\t\t\t\"isPassthroughQueue\": false,\n\t\t\t\"isRejectQueue\": false,\n\t\t\t\"isEventActive\": true,\n\t\t\t\"isEventPrequeueing\": false,\n\t\t\t\"timeUntilEventStart\": 0,\n\t\t\t\"timeUntilEventStartFormatted\": \"unavailable\",\n\t\t\t\"timeUntilEventEnd\": 15,\n\t\t\t\"timeUntilEventEndFormatted\": \"15 minutes\",\n\t\t\t\"shuffleAtEventStart\": true\n\t\t}\n\t}"

                                  Sets the queueing method used by the waiting
                                  room. Changing this parameter from the
                                  **default** queueing method is only available
                                  for the Waiting Room Advanced subscription.
                                  Regardless of the queueing method, if
                                  `queue_all` is enabled or an event is
                                  prequeueing, users in the waiting room will
                                  not be accepted to the origin. These users
                                  will always see a waiting room page that
                                  refreshes automatically. The valid queueing
                                  methods are:

                                  1. `fifo` **(default)**: First-In-First-Out
                                  queue where customers gain access in the order
                                  they arrived.

                                  2. `random`: Random queue where customers gain
                                  access randomly, regardless of arrival time.

                                  3. `passthrough`: Users will pass directly
                                  through the waiting room and into the origin
                                  website. As a result, any configured limits
                                  will not be respected while this is enabled.
                                  This method can be used as an alternative to
                                  disabling a waiting room (with `suspended`) so
                                  that analytics are still reported. This can be
                                  used if you wish to allow all traffic
                                  normally, but want to restrict traffic during
                                  a waiting room event, or vice versa.

                                  4. `reject`: Users will be immediately
                                  rejected from the waiting room. As a result,
                                  no users will reach the origin website while
                                  this is enabled. This can be used if you wish
                                  to reject all traffic while performing
                                  maintenance, block traffic during a specified
                                  period of time (an event), or block traffic
                                  while events are not occurring. Consider a
                                  waiting room used for vaccine distribution
                                  that only allows traffic during sign-up
                                  events, and otherwise blocks all traffic. For
                                  this case, the waiting room uses `reject`, and
                                  its events override this with `fifo`,
                                  `random`, or `passthrough`. When this queueing
                                  method is enabled and neither `queueAll` is
                                  enabled nor an event is prequeueing, the
                                  waiting room page **will not refresh
                                  automatically**.
