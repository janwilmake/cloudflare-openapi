    Welcome to Cloudflare's API documentation site. We are experimenting with an
    updated version of our API documentation - check out
    [developers.cloudflare.com/api-next/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api-next/)
    to test out the new experience.


    To get started using Cloudflare's products and services via the API, refer
    to [how to interact with
    Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/basic-tasks/interact-with-cloudflare/),
    which covers using tools like
    [Terraform](https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/#cloudflare-terraform)
    and the [official
    SDKs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/reference/sdks/) to
    maintain your Cloudflare resources.


    Using the Cloudflare API requires authentication so that Cloudflare knows
    who is making requests and what permissions you have. Create an API token to
    grant access to the API to perform actions. You can also authenticate with
    [API
    keys](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/keys/),
    but these keys have [several
    limitations](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/keys/#limitations)
    that make them less secure than API tokens. Whenever possible, use API
    tokens to interact with the Cloudflare API.


    To create an API token, from the Cloudflare dashboard, go to My Profile >
    API Tokens and select Create Token. For more information on how to create
    and troubleshoot API tokens, refer to

    our [API fundamentals](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/).


    For information regarding rate limits, refer to our [API Rate
    Limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/platform/limits/#api-rate-limits).

      description: "Creates a waiting room page preview. Upload a custom waiting room page for preview. You will receive a preview URL in the form `http://waitingrooms.dev/preview/<uuid>`. You can use the following query parameters to change the state of the preview:\n1. `force_queue`: Boolean indicating if all users will be queued in the waiting room and no one will be let into the origin website (also known as queueAll).\n2. `queue_is_full`: Boolean indicating if the waiting room's queue is currently full and not accepting new users at the moment.\n3. `queueing_method`: The queueing method currently used by the waiting room.\n\t- **fifo** indicates a FIFO queue.\n\t- **random** indicates a Random queue.\n\t- **passthrough** indicates a Passthrough queue. Keep in mind that the waiting room page will only be displayed if `force_queue=true` or `event=prequeueing` â€” for other cases the request will pass through to the origin. For our preview, this will be a fake origin website returning \\\"Welcome\\\". \n\t- **reject** indicates a Reject queue.\n4. `event`: Used to preview a waiting room event.\n\t- **none** indicates no event is occurring.\n\t- **prequeueing** indicates that an event is prequeueing (between `prequeue_start_time` and `event_start_time`).\n\t- **started** indicates that an event has started (between `event_start_time` and `event_end_time`).\n5. `shuffle_at_event_start`: Boolean indicating if the event will shuffle users in the prequeue when it starts. This can only be set to **true** if an event is active (`event` is not **none**).\n\nFor example, you can make a request to `http://waitingrooms.dev/preview/<uuid>?force_queue=false&queue_is_full=false&queueing_method=random&event=started&shuffle_at_event_start=true`\n6. `waitTime`: Non-zero, positive integer indicating the estimated wait time in minutes. The default value is 10 minutes.\n\nFor example, you can make a request to `http://waitingrooms.dev/preview/<uuid>?waitTime=50` to configure the estimated wait time as 50 minutes."

                    This is a template html file that will be rendered at the
                    edge. If no custom_page_html is provided, the default
                    waiting room will be used. The template is based on mustache
                    ( https://mustache.github.io/ ). There are several variables
                    that are evaluated by the Cloudflare edge:

                    1. {{`waitTimeKnown`}} Acts like a boolean value that
                    indicates the behavior to take when wait time is not
                    available, for instance when queue_all is **true**.

                    2. {{`waitTimeFormatted`}} Estimated wait time for the user.
                    For example, five minutes. Alternatively, you can use:

                    3. {{`waitTime`}} Number of minutes of estimated wait for a
                    user.

                    4. {{`waitTimeHours`}} Number of hours of estimated wait for
                    a user (`Math.floor(waitTime/60)`).

                    5. {{`waitTimeHourMinutes`}} Number of minutes above the
                    `waitTimeHours` value (`waitTime%60`).

                    6. {{`queueIsFull`}} Changes to **true** when no more people
                    can be added to the queue.


                    To view the full list of variables, look at the
                    `cfWaitingRoom` object described under the
                    `json_response_enabled` property in other Waiting Room API
                    calls.
