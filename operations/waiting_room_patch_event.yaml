    Welcome to Cloudflare's API documentation site. We are experimenting with an
    updated version of our API documentation - check out
    [developers.cloudflare.com/api-next/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api-next/)
    to test out the new experience.


    To get started using Cloudflare's products and services via the API, refer
    to [how to interact with
    Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/basic-tasks/interact-with-cloudflare/),
    which covers using tools like
    [Terraform](https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/#cloudflare-terraform)
    and the [official
    SDKs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/reference/sdks/) to
    maintain your Cloudflare resources.


    Using the Cloudflare API requires authentication so that Cloudflare knows
    who is making requests and what permissions you have. Create an API token to
    grant access to the API to perform actions. You can also authenticate with
    [API
    keys](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/keys/),
    but these keys have [several
    limitations](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/keys/#limitations)
    that make them less secure than API tokens. Whenever possible, use API
    tokens to interact with the Cloudflare API.


    To create an API token, from the Cloudflare dashboard, go to My Profile >
    API Tokens and select Create Token. For more information on how to create
    and troubleshoot API tokens, refer to

    our [API fundamentals](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/).


    For information regarding rate limits, refer to our [API Rate
    Limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/platform/limits/#api-rate-limits).

                    `prequeue_start_time` is not null. This is useful for
                    situations when many users will join the event prequeue at
                    the same time and you want to shuffle them to ensure
                    fairness. Naturally, it makes the most sense to enable this
                    feature when the `queueing_method` during the event respects
                    ordering such as **fifo**, or else the shuffling may be
                    unnecessary.

                              most sense to enable this feature when the
                              `queueing_method` during the event respects
                              ordering such as **fifo**, or else the shuffling
                              may be unnecessary.

                                  queueing all users before the event starts.
                                  The prequeue must start at least five minutes
                                  before `event_start_time`.

                                  shuffled randomly at the `event_start_time`.
                                  Requires that `prequeue_start_time` is not
                                  null. This is useful for situations when many
                                  users will join the event prequeue at the same
                                  time and you want to shuffle them to ensure
                                  fairness. Naturally, it makes the most sense
                                  to enable this feature when the
                                  `queueing_method` during the event respects
                                  ordering such as **fifo**, or else the
                                  shuffling may be unnecessary.
