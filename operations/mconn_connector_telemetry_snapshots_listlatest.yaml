    Welcome to Cloudflare's API documentation site. We are experimenting with an
    updated version of our API documentation - check out
    [developers.cloudflare.com/api-next/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api-next/)
    to test out the new experience.


    To get started using Cloudflare's products and services via the API, refer
    to [how to interact with
    Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/basic-tasks/interact-with-cloudflare/),
    which covers using tools like
    [Terraform](https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/#cloudflare-terraform)
    and the [official
    SDKs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/reference/sdks/) to
    maintain your Cloudflare resources.


    Using the Cloudflare API requires authentication so that Cloudflare knows
    who is making requests and what permissions you have. Create an API token to
    grant access to the API to perform actions. You can also authenticate with
    [API
    keys](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/keys/),
    but these keys have [several
    limitations](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/keys/#limitations)
    that make them less secure than API tokens. Whenever possible, use API
    tokens to interact with the Cloudflare API.


    To create an API token, from the Cloudflare dashboard, go to My Profile >
    API Tokens and select Create Token. For more information on how to create
    and troubleshoot API tokens, refer to

    our [API fundamentals](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/).


    For information regarding rate limits, refer to our [API Rate
    Limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/platform/limits/#api-rate-limits).
