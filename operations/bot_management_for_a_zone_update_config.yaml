    Welcome to Cloudflare's API documentation site. We are experimenting with an
    updated version of our API documentation - check out
    [developers.cloudflare.com/api-next/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api-next/)
    to test out the new experience.


    To get started using Cloudflare's products and services via the API, refer
    to [how to interact with
    Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/basic-tasks/interact-with-cloudflare/),
    which covers using tools like
    [Terraform](https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/#cloudflare-terraform)
    and the [official
    SDKs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/reference/sdks/) to
    maintain your Cloudflare resources.


    Using the Cloudflare API requires authentication so that Cloudflare knows
    who is making requests and what permissions you have. Create an API token to
    grant access to the API to perform actions. You can also authenticate with
    [API
    keys](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/keys/),
    but these keys have [several
    limitations](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/keys/#limitations)
    that make them less secure than API tokens. Whenever possible, use API
    tokens to interact with the Cloudflare API.


    To create an API token, from the Cloudflare dashboard, go to My Profile >
    API Tokens and select Create Token. For more information on how to create
    and troubleshoot API tokens, refer to

    our [API fundamentals](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/).


    For information regarding rate limits, refer to our [API Rate
    Limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/platform/limits/#api-rate-limits).

        Updates the Bot Management configuration for a zone.


        This API is used to update:

        - **Bot Fight Mode**

        - **Super Bot Fight Mode**

        - **Bot Management for Enterprise**


        See [Bot Plans](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/plans/) for more
        information on the different plans 

        \

        If you recently upgraded or downgraded your plan, refer to the following
        examples to clean up old configurations. 

        Copy and paste the example body to remove old zone configurations based
        on your current plan.

        #### Clean up configuration for Bot Fight Mode plan

        ```json

        {
          "sbfm_likely_automated": "allow", 
          "sbfm_definitely_automated": "allow", 
          "sbfm_verified_bots": "allow", 
          "sbfm_static_resource_protection": false, 
          "optimize_wordpress": false, 
          "suppress_session_score": false 
        }

        ```

        #### Clean up configuration for SBFM Pro plan

        ```json

        {
          "sbfm_likely_automated": "allow", 
          "fight_mode": false 
        }

        ```

        #### Clean up configuration for SBFM Biz plan

        ```json

        {
          "fight_mode": false
        }

        ```

        #### Clean up configuration for BM Enterprise Subscription plan

        It is strongly recommended that you ensure you have [custom
        rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/) in place to
        protect your zone before disabling the SBFM rules. Without these
        protections, your zone is vulnerable to attacks.

        ```json

        {
          "sbfm_likely_automated": "allow", 
          "sbfm_definitely_automated": "allow", 
          "sbfm_verified_bots": "allow", 
          "sbfm_static_resource_protection": false, 
          "optimize_wordpress": false, 
          "fight_mode": false
        }
